# Fletch Questions (FQ-1 to FQ-4)

## FQ-1: What Is It?

**What it is:** A first-time visitor can answer "What is this product?" within 5 seconds of landing on the homepage — in plain language, not marketing jargon.

**Why it matters:** Fletch PMM's research across hundreds of B2B SaaS homepages found that the #1 positioning failure is a homepage that doesn't pass the "what is it?" test. If a visitor can't identify the product's basic function quickly, nothing else on the page matters — they'll leave before reading your differentiators, pricing, or social proof.

**PASS criteria:**
- A first-time visitor can state what the product does in one sentence after 5 seconds
- The headline or sub-headline describes the product's function, not just an outcome
- No jargon required to understand what it is

**FAIL criteria:**
- Headline is a vague aspiration ("Unlock your potential," "The future of work")
- Product function only becomes clear after scrolling or reading several sections
- Requires industry knowledge to understand what's being sold

## FQ-2: Who Is It For?

**What it is:** The homepage clearly signals the intended buyer or user — by role, team, industry, company stage, or problem they face.

**Why it matters:** B2B buyers self-select quickly. If they don't see themselves reflected on the homepage — their title, their pain, their context — they assume the product isn't for them and leave. Fletch emphasizes that "for everyone" messaging is the fastest way to be for no one.

**PASS criteria:**
- Target audience is named explicitly (role, team, industry, or company type)
- Social proof (logos, testimonials, case studies) matches the stated audience
- A visitor outside the target can tell this product isn't primarily for them

**FAIL criteria:**
- No audience specified — the page reads as "for everyone" or "for businesses"
- Mixed signals: headline targets one audience, social proof targets another
- Audience only mentioned deep on the page (below the fold)

## FQ-3: What Does It Replace?

**What it is:** The homepage makes clear what the customer is currently doing that this product improves upon — the manual process, the existing tool, or the status quo being disrupted.

**Why it matters:** Buyers need context to evaluate a new product. "What am I using today?" is the anchor against which they judge value. Fletch argues this is the most underused positioning lever in B2B SaaS — most homepages describe what they do but never what they replace, leaving the visitor to make the connection themselves.

**Source:** Pierri, A. & Fralic, R. Fletch PMM — "The Homepage Teardown" methodology (2020–2024).

**PASS criteria:**
- Homepage states or strongly implies what the customer currently uses (spreadsheets, manual process, a competitor, nothing)
- The replacement frame makes the product's value obvious by contrast
- Phrasing like "Replace your…," "Stop using…," "Instead of…" or a before/after comparison

**FAIL criteria:**
- No mention of current state, alternatives, or what the product displaces
- Product presented in a vacuum — no anchoring to the customer's existing workflow
- Only positive claims ("We help you…") without contrast to the status quo

## FQ-4: Why Is It Better?

**What it is:** The homepage articulates a clear, specific reason why this product is superior to the alternative it replaces — not just "different," but better in a way the target customer cares about.

**Why it matters:** Differentiation without superiority is just trivia. Fletch's framework emphasizes that answering "why better" is the final gate: a visitor who understands what it is, who it's for, and what it replaces still won't convert unless they believe it's meaningfully better. The reason must be concrete and verifiable, not a subjective claim.

**Source:** Pierri, A. & Fralic, R. Fletch PMM — "The Homepage Teardown" methodology (2020–2024).

**PASS criteria:**
- At least one specific, verifiable reason the product beats the alternative (speed, accuracy, cost, ease, integration)
- The "better" claim is quantified or demonstrated (numbers, demo, before/after)
- The advantage maps to something the target audience actually values

**FAIL criteria:**
- Only vague superiority claims ("the best," "industry-leading," "world-class")
- Differentiators are features every competitor also has
- No comparison — the product is described in isolation without any "better than" framing
