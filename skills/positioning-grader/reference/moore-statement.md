# Moore Statement (MS-1 to MS-6)

## MS-1: Target Customer Named

**What it is:** The homepage content allows you to fill in the "For [target customer]" slot of Moore's positioning statement — the specific buyer or user persona the product serves.

**Why it matters:** Moore's template begins with the customer for a reason: positioning is not about the product, it's about the customer's context. If you can't fill this slot from the homepage, the positioning lacks a foundation. Every subsequent slot (need, category, benefit, differentiator) depends on knowing who you're talking to.

**Source:** Moore, G. A. *Crossing the Chasm: Marketing and Selling Disruptive Products to Mainstream Customers* (1991, 3rd ed. 2014), Chapter 7 — "The Positioning Statement."

**PASS criteria:**
- A specific customer segment can be extracted from the homepage (role, title, team, industry, or company type)
- The target is narrow enough to be meaningful — not "businesses" or "teams" generically
- Content is written as if speaking to this specific person

**FAIL criteria:**
- No identifiable target customer — the page speaks to everyone
- Target is only implied by logos/testimonials but never stated
- Multiple conflicting targets addressed simultaneously without hierarchy

## MS-2: Customer Need Articulated

**What it is:** The homepage content allows you to fill in the "who [need/problem]" slot — the specific pain, gap, or job-to-be-done the target customer faces.

**Why it matters:** Without a stated need, the product is a solution looking for a problem. Moore argues that the need must be one the customer already recognizes — if you have to educate them about the problem, you're not crossing the chasm, you're widening it. The homepage should name the pain so the visitor nods in recognition.

**Source:** Moore, G. A. *Crossing the Chasm* (1991, 3rd ed. 2014), Chapter 7.

**PASS criteria:**
- A specific problem, pain point, or job-to-be-done is stated on the homepage
- The need is described in the customer's language, not the vendor's
- The visitor can recognize their own situation in the description

**FAIL criteria:**
- No problem or need mentioned — only product capabilities described
- Need is too vague ("improve your business," "work smarter")
- Problem is stated in vendor jargon the customer wouldn't use

## MS-3: Product Category Clear

**What it is:** The homepage content allows you to fill in the "[product] is a [category]" slot — the market category or type of product the customer should compare it to.

**Why it matters:** Moore's category slot is the "mental shelf" — it tells the visitor what expectations to bring, what competitors to compare against, and what price range seems reasonable. Without it, the visitor has no frame of reference. Moore warns that creating a new category is extremely expensive; most products should position within a recognized one.

**Source:** Moore, G. A. *Crossing the Chasm* (1991, 3rd ed. 2014), Chapter 7.

**PASS criteria:**
- Product is placed in a recognizable existing category (e.g., "CRM," "analytics platform," "workflow automation")
- Category is stated or strongly implied in the headline, sub-headline, or first paragraph
- If creating a new subcategory, it's clearly anchored to a known parent category

**FAIL criteria:**
- No category identifiable — visitor can't tell what kind of product this is
- Category is invented jargon ("revenue orchestration engine")
- Product described only by what it does, never by what it is

## MS-4: Key Benefit Stated

**What it is:** The homepage content allows you to fill in the "that [key benefit]" slot — the primary value the product delivers to the target customer.

**Why it matters:** The benefit is the payoff — it's the reason the customer switches from the alternative. Moore's framework insists on a single key benefit, not a feature list. Multiple benefits dilute the message and make it harder for the visitor to remember and repeat your positioning to their colleagues (critical in B2B buying committees).

**Source:** Moore, G. A. *Crossing the Chasm* (1991, 3rd ed. 2014), Chapter 7.

**PASS criteria:**
- A clear primary benefit is stated prominently (usually in the headline or sub-headline)
- Benefit is an outcome for the customer, not a feature of the product
- Benefit is specific enough to be memorable and repeatable

**FAIL criteria:**
- No clear benefit — only features listed
- Multiple competing benefits with no hierarchy (the visitor can't identify the primary one)
- Benefit is generic ("save time," "reduce costs") without specificity

---

## MS-5: Competitive Alternative Referenced

**What it is:** The homepage content allows you to fill in the "Unlike [alternative]" slot — the specific product, process, or approach that the target customer would use instead.

**Why it matters:** Positioning is inherently comparative. Moore's "Unlike" slot forces an explicit contrast that sharpens the product's identity. Without it, the visitor doesn't know what mental yardstick to use. This overlaps with Dunford's DC-1 but Moore's framing is about the statement test — can you literally fill in the blank?

**Source:** Moore, G. A. *Crossing the Chasm* (1991, 3rd ed. 2014), Chapter 7.

**PASS criteria:**
- A competitive alternative is named or strongly implied (a tool, a process, a manual approach)
- The contrast is realistic — it's what the target customer actually uses today
- The homepage uses comparative language ("unlike," "instead of," "replace")

**FAIL criteria:**
- No competitive frame — product described without any anchoring to alternatives
- Alternative is a strawman nobody actually uses
- Competitive comparison only found on a separate "vs" page, not the homepage

## MS-6: Primary Differentiator Expressed

**What it is:** The homepage content allows you to fill in the "[product] [differentiator]" slot — the single most important reason this product wins against the stated alternative.

**Why it matters:** The differentiator is the final slot and the clincher of the positioning statement. Moore's template ends here because this is what the customer takes away: "Oh, it's like [alternative] but [differentiator]." If this slot is empty, the product is perceived as just another option in the category — and the decision defaults to price or brand familiarity.

**Source:** Moore, G. A. *Crossing the Chasm* (1991, 3rd ed. 2014), Chapter 7.

**PASS criteria:**
- A single primary differentiator is clearly expressed (not a list of 5 things)
- The differentiator is specific and verifiable — not an unsubstantiated claim
- It directly addresses why the product wins over the named alternative

**FAIL criteria:**
- No clear differentiator — the product reads as equivalent to alternatives
- Multiple differentiators listed with equal weight (none stands out)
- Differentiator is a subjective claim ("best-in-class") rather than a provable fact
