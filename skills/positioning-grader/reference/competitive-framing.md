# Competitive Framing (CF-1 to CF-5)

## CF-1: Before/After Contrast

**What it is:** The homepage presents a clear contrast between the customer's current painful state (before) and their improved state after using the product (after).

**Why it matters:** Before/after framing is one of the most effective persuasion structures because it makes the value gap visible. When the visitor can see the distance between their current pain and the promised outcome, the product becomes the bridge. Without this contrast, value is abstract. Ries and Trout's positioning law states that the mind works by comparison — you must provide the right comparison or the visitor will make an unflattering one.

**Source:** Ries, A. & Trout, J. *Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind* (1981, 20th anniversary ed. 2001), Chapter 2 — "The Assault on the Mind." Supported by MECLABS testing showing before/after framing increases conversion by clarifying the value gap.

**PASS criteria:**
- Homepage shows a clear before state (the pain, the manual process, the status quo)
- After state is concrete — a specific improved outcome, not a vague promise
- The product is positioned as the mechanism that bridges the gap
- Could be explicit (before/after sections) or implicit (problem → solution flow)

**FAIL criteria:**
- Only the "after" is described — no acknowledgment of the customer's current pain
- Before/after is too abstract to visualize ("Transform your business" doesn't count)
- Problem and solution are disconnected — stated in different sections without a narrative thread

## CF-2: Category Ownership Claim

**What it is:** The homepage signals that this product is the defining player in its category — or is actively creating a new subcategory it can own.

**Why it matters:** Ries and Trout's foundational principle is that it's better to be first in a category than to be better. If you can't be first, create a new category you can be first in. The homepage should either claim the #1 position in an existing category (with proof) or define a new subcategory that the product owns by default. This is not about arrogance — it's about giving the visitor a mental anchor.

**Source:** Ries, A. & Trout, J. *Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind* (1981, 20th anniversary ed. 2001), Chapter 3 — "Getting Into the Mind." Law of Leadership and Law of Category from *The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing* (1993).

**PASS criteria:**
- Homepage positions the product as the leader or creator of its category/subcategory
- Leadership claim is supported by evidence (market share, user count, awards, analyst recognition)
- If creating a new subcategory, it's clearly defined and the product is its obvious first inhabitant
- Language signals authority: "the," "first," "#1," "leading," "invented," "pioneered"

**FAIL criteria:**
- Product presented as one of many options — no leadership or ownership positioning
- Claims #1 position without any supporting evidence
- Category is too crowded and the product doesn't claim a distinct niche or subcategory
- Hedging language: "one of the best," "a top choice," "among the leaders"

## CF-3: Single Word/Concept Ownership

**What it is:** The homepage messaging can be distilled to a single word or concept that the product "owns" in the visitor's mind.

**Why it matters:** Ries and Trout's Law of Focus states that the most powerful positioning strategy is to own a word in the prospect's mind. Volvo owns "safety." FedEx owns "overnight." Salesforce owns "CRM." The homepage should reinforce one dominant concept through repetition, imagery, and structure. When a product tries to own multiple concepts, it ends up owning none.

**Source:** Ries, A. & Trout, J. *The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing* (1993), Law #5 — "The Law of Focus." Also in *Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind* (1981), Chapter 8 — "The Perception Ladder."

**PASS criteria:**
- One dominant concept or word is reinforced throughout the homepage (in headline, sub-headline, features, CTA)
- The concept is specific enough to own (not "innovation" or "quality" — too generic)
- A visitor leaving the homepage could summarize the product in one word or phrase
- The concept directly ties to the product's primary differentiator

**FAIL criteria:**
- Homepage tries to communicate 4+ unrelated concepts with equal emphasis
- No single takeaway — visitors leave unsure what the product is primarily about
- Concept is too generic to be ownable (every competitor could claim the same word)
- Messaging changes tone/focus between sections without a unifying thread

## CF-4: Competitive Repositioning

**What it is:** The homepage reframes how the visitor thinks about the existing alternatives — making competitors' strengths look like weaknesses or outdated approaches.

**Why it matters:** Ries and Trout argue that in a crowded market, you can't just promote your product — you must reposition the competition. This doesn't mean attacking competitors; it means changing the criteria by which the visitor evaluates the category. If the incumbent is known for being "comprehensive," you reposition comprehensiveness as "bloated" and position simplicity as the new standard. This is the judo move of positioning.

**Source:** Ries, A. & Trout, J. *Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind* (1981), Chapter 10 — "The Repositioning Game." Also supported by Dunford, A. *Obviously Awesome* (2019) — "Reframing the market category."

**PASS criteria:**
- Homepage shifts the evaluation criteria — makes the visitor question their current approach
- Competitors' strengths are subtly reframed (e.g., "Why pay for features you don't use?" reframes comprehensiveness)
- New buying criteria are established that favor this product's strengths
- Reframing is done through contrast, not direct competitor attacks

**FAIL criteria:**
- Homepage accepts the existing competitive criteria and tries to win on the incumbent's terms
- No attempt to change how the visitor evaluates the category
- Direct competitor bashing (names competitors negatively) — unprofessional and often backfires
- Product positioned as "same but cheaper" — commodity framing

**N/A when:** The product is genuinely first in a new category with no established alternatives to reposition against.

## CF-5: Ladder Position Acknowledged

**What it is:** The homepage messaging is consistent with the product's actual position on the competitive ladder — #1 plays offense, #2 plays against #1, smaller players find niches.

**Why it matters:** Ries and Trout's "ladder" concept states that the visitor's mind holds a ranking of products in each category. Your strategy must match your rung. A #2 player that talks like a market leader looks delusional. A market leader that acknowledges competitors gives them oxygen. A small player that competes head-on with the leader loses. The homepage messaging should reflect honest self-awareness of competitive position.

**Source:** Ries, A. & Trout, J. *Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind* (1981), Chapter 5 — "You Can't Get There from Here." Also Chapter 12 — "The Positioning of a Follower."

**PASS criteria:**
- Market leader: Claims authority broadly, talks about the category, doesn't mention competitors
- Challenger (#2-3): Positions against the leader, highlights where the leader falls short
- Niche player: Claims a specific segment and owns it completely, doesn't pretend to compete everywhere
- The approach matches the company's actual market position (evidenced by company size, funding, market share)

**FAIL criteria:**
- Small startup messaging reads like a Fortune 500 company ("We're the global leader")
- Market leader naming small competitors — gives them free visibility
- Challenger positioning as #1 when the market clearly has an established leader
- No strategic awareness — messaging doesn't align with competitive reality

**N/A when:** The product is in a new category with no established competitive ladder.
