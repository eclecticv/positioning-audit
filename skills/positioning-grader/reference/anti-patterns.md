# Anti-Patterns (AP-1 to AP-18)

Scoring note: PASS means the anti-pattern is NOT detected (good positioning). FAIL means the anti-pattern IS detected (positioning problem).

---

## AP-1: Default Positioning

**What it is:** The product is still described in terms of its original conception — the language, category, and framing from the founding story — even though the market has evolved and the product's real value has shifted.

**Why it matters:** Products evolve faster than their positioning. Teams ship features that serve new use cases, but the homepage still tells the founding narrative. This is Dunford's most common positioning trap: the company is succeeding despite its positioning, not because of it. Visitors who would benefit most from the current product never realize it because the homepage describes the version from two years ago.

**Source:** Dunford, A. *Obviously Awesome* (2019), Trap #1 — "Default Positioning." Also Dunford, A. "Most Startups Have Never Revisited Their Positioning," *First Round Review* (2020).

**PASS criteria:**
- Product description reflects its current primary use case and value
- Language is current — no references to features or approaches that suggest the original pitch deck
- Category framing matches what the product actually does today

**FAIL criteria:**
- Homepage describes the product in terms of what it was originally built to do
- Key features or use cases are buried while the original pitch occupies the headline
- Testimonials describe value the homepage doesn't mention

---

## AP-2: Me-Too Positioning

**What it is:** The homepage could belong to any competitor in the category — the messaging, claims, and framing are interchangeable with similar products.

**Why it matters:** If a visitor can swap out your company name for a competitor's and the homepage still makes sense, you have no positioning — you have a category description. Me-too positioning leads to price-based competition and low conversion rates because the visitor has no reason to choose you specifically.

**Source:** Dunford, A. *Obviously Awesome* (2019), Trap #2 — "Me-Too Positioning." Also Ries, A. & Trout, J. *Positioning* (1981), Chapter 12 — "The Positioning of a Follower."

**PASS criteria:**
- At least one claim, feature, or framing on the homepage is unique to this product
- Messaging could NOT be swapped onto a competitor's homepage without changes
- Differentiation is substantive, not just cosmetic (different words for the same thing)

**FAIL criteria:**
- Headline and sub-headline could describe any product in the category
- Feature list is table-stakes for the category (security, speed, scalability, ease of use)
- No competitive differentiation visible above the fold

---

## AP-3: Wishful Thinking Positioning

**What it is:** The homepage claims a positioning the product hasn't earned — aspirational market leadership, unsubstantiated performance claims, or credibility signals that don't match the company's actual stage.

**Why it matters:** Aspirational positioning destroys trust. When a seed-stage startup claims to be "the leading enterprise platform" or a product with 50 users says "trusted by thousands," visitors who investigate will feel deceived. Even those who don't investigate often sense the mismatch intuitively — the design, the depth of content, and the social proof don't support the claims being made.

**Source:** Dunford, A. *Obviously Awesome* (2019), Trap #3 — "Wishful Thinking."

**PASS criteria:**
- Claims on the homepage are supportable by evidence visible on the page or easily verifiable
- Social proof matches the company's actual scale (not inflated)
- Market position claims align with what an informed visitor would expect

**FAIL criteria:**
- Leadership claims without evidence ("the leading platform for…")
- User/customer numbers that seem inflated relative to the company's stage
- Enterprise positioning from a clearly early-stage product (pricing, design, and content depth don't match)

---

## AP-4: Positioning by Committee

**What it is:** The homepage reads as a compromise — trying to satisfy multiple internal stakeholders (sales, product, marketing, founders) with language that pleases everyone but resonates with no one.

**Why it matters:** Committee-driven messaging is recognizable by its blandness. When every team gets a say, sharp positioning is sanded down to inoffensive generalities. The result is a homepage that's technically accurate but strategically empty — it describes the product without positioning it. Dunford identifies this as the #1 organizational barrier to effective positioning.

**Source:** Dunford, A. *Obviously Awesome* (2019), Trap #4 — "Positioning by Committee."

**PASS criteria:**
- Messaging has a clear point of view — it takes a stance
- One audience is prioritized over others
- Language is specific and sharp, not hedged or qualified

**FAIL criteria:**
- Messaging is bland, generic, and inoffensive — reads like a press release
- Multiple audiences addressed with equal priority (developers AND executives AND marketers)
- Hedging language throughout ("comprehensive," "flexible," "versatile," "powerful yet simple")

---

## AP-5: Positioning for Investors

**What it is:** The homepage speaks in investor language — TAM, market opportunity, vision, and capability claims that impress VCs but confuse customers.

**Why it matters:** Teams that recently fundraised often carry pitch-deck language onto their homepage. Investors care about market size and vision; customers care about what the product does for them right now. When the homepage reads like a slide deck, it signals that the company is more focused on raising money than serving customers.

**Source:** Dunford, A. *Obviously Awesome* (2019), Trap #5 — "Positioning for Investors, Not Customers."

**PASS criteria:**
- Messaging is customer-centric — describes problems the customer has and outcomes they want
- No VC jargon (TAM, disrupting, market opportunity, paradigm)
- Value proposition speaks to the user's daily workflow, not the company's ambition

**FAIL criteria:**
- Homepage uses investor language ("disrupting the $X billion market")
- Vision statements dominate over product descriptions
- Company story/mission prominently placed above product value
- Buzzword density suggests the audience is investors, not users

---

## AP-6: Stuck in the Past

**What it is:** The homepage leads with legacy strengths, founding-era technology, or historical achievements that the market no longer values as primary differentiators.

**Why it matters:** Markets shift. What made a product special five years ago may be table-stakes today. When the homepage leads with "Since 2015" or emphasizes a technology stack that's no longer novel, it signals to visitors that the company is resting on its laurels rather than evolving. Positioning must reflect current competitive dynamics, not historical ones.

**Source:** Dunford, A. *Obviously Awesome* (2019), Trap #6 — "Stuck in the Past."

**PASS criteria:**
- Leading differentiators are still competitively relevant
- Technology and approach descriptions reflect the current market landscape
- Heritage is mentioned for credibility but doesn't dominate the positioning

**FAIL criteria:**
- Primary differentiator is something competitors have long since matched
- Founding story or original technology prominently featured as the main selling point
- "Established in [year]" used as a primary trust signal when the market values innovation
- Feature emphasis is on capabilities that are now commodity

---

## AP-7: Trend-Riding

**What it is:** The homepage positions primarily around a market trend or buzzword (AI, blockchain, cloud-native) without substantiating how the product uniquely leverages that trend.

**Why it matters:** When every product in a category adds "AI-powered" to their headline, the term loses all differentiating value. Trend-riding is the positioning equivalent of greenwashing — it borrows credibility from a movement without earning it. Visitors who are genuinely looking for AI capabilities will dig deeper and find the claim hollow; others will dismiss it as marketing noise.

**Source:** Dunford, A. *Obviously Awesome* (2019), Trap #8 — "Riding a Trend." Also Ries, A. & Trout, J. *Positioning* (1981) — on the danger of following fads instead of owning a position.

**PASS criteria:**
- If trend terms are used (AI, ML, etc.), they're substantiated with specifics (what the AI does, what data it uses, what outcome it produces)
- The trend is integral to the product's value, not a marketing veneer
- The product would still have a clear position if the buzzword were removed

**FAIL criteria:**
- "AI-powered" or similar trend terms in the headline without explanation
- Trend term used 3+ times on the homepage without specific substantiation
- Remove the buzzword and the homepage has no clear positioning
- Product category is defined by the trend rather than the customer outcome

---

## AP-8: Confusing Positioning with Messaging

**What it is:** The homepage has a catchy tagline or headline but no underlying positioning strategy — the words sound good but don't convey a coherent competitive position.

**Why it matters:** Messaging is the expression of positioning; it's not positioning itself. A clever tagline without strategic foundation is just creative writing. The test: can you reconstruct the positioning strategy from the homepage? If not, the messaging is floating — it may resonate emotionally but fails to anchor the product in the visitor's competitive mental map.

**Source:** Dunford, A. *Obviously Awesome* (2019), Trap #9 — "Confusing Messaging with Positioning."

**PASS criteria:**
- Headline and messaging convey a clear competitive position (who it's for, what it replaces, why it's better)
- Messaging is consistent throughout the page — headline, features, CTA, social proof tell the same story
- A positioning statement could be reconstructed from the homepage content

**FAIL criteria:**
- Catchy headline that sounds good but doesn't communicate what the product is or who it's for
- Messaging changes tone or focus between page sections — no unified strategy
- Tagline-driven: remove the clever wording and there's no substance underneath
- Multiple unrelated value propositions crammed onto one page

---

## AP-9: Positioning Too Broadly

**What it is:** The homepage tries to position the product for every possible market segment, use case, and buyer persona simultaneously.

**Why it matters:** Broad positioning is the instinct of companies afraid of leaving money on the table. But Ries and Trout's research, Dunford's framework, and Fletch's consulting experience all converge on the same conclusion: narrower positioning wins. A product positioned for "all businesses" loses to one positioned for "mid-market SaaS finance teams." The broad player has to outspend the focused player to win any specific segment.

**Source:** Dunford, A. *Obviously Awesome* (2019), Trap #10. Ries, A. & Trout, J. *The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing* (1993), Law #5 — "The Law of Focus."

**PASS criteria:**
- One primary target segment is clear from the homepage
- Use cases are focused — not an exhaustive list of "who can use this"
- Messaging would deliberately exclude some potential buyers

**FAIL criteria:**
- "For businesses of all sizes" or "for teams across industries"
- 5+ use cases listed on the homepage with equal prominence
- No clear primary audience — the product is positioned as universal

---

## AP-10: Speaking to Multiple Audiences

**What it is:** The homepage tries to address different buyer personas simultaneously — mixing developer language with executive language, or targeting both SMB and enterprise buyers in the same flow.

**Why it matters:** Each audience has different pain points, decision criteria, and language. When the homepage tries to speak to all of them, each audience finds only a fraction of the page relevant to them. Fletch's homepage teardowns consistently find that the highest-converting B2B pages pick one audience and speak to them with full commitment, using separate pages or sections for other personas.

**Source:** Pierri, A. & Fralic, R. Fletch PMM — "The Homepage Teardown" methodology (2020–2024). Common anti-pattern in homepage teardown analyses.

**PASS criteria:**
- Homepage speaks to one primary persona consistently
- Language, technical depth, and value propositions are calibrated for a single audience
- Other audiences are served through navigation (e.g., "For Developers," "For Enterprise") not the main page flow

**FAIL criteria:**
- Homepage alternates between technical and business language
- Hero targets one persona, features section targets another
- Multiple "For X" call-outs on the same page with equal prominence
- Testimonials represent wildly different buyer types without hierarchy

---

## AP-11: Wrong Champion Targeted

**What it is:** The homepage targets the wrong person in the buying process — typically the end-user when the economic buyer decides, or the executive when the practitioner evaluates.

**Why it matters:** In B2B, the person who lands on the homepage may not be the person who signs the check. Fletch identifies that many SaaS companies target the user but the purchase decision is made by a manager or VP. The homepage should target whoever is most likely to land there AND has the most influence on the purchase decision. Targeting the wrong champion means the message doesn't reach the person who can act on it.

**Source:** Pierri, A. & Fralic, R. Fletch PMM — "Choosing the Right Champion" (2020–2024).

**PASS criteria:**
- Homepage messaging targets the person most likely to visit AND influence the purchase
- Value propositions match the decision criteria of the target champion (ROI for executives, workflow for practitioners)
- Social proof features people in the same role as the target champion

**FAIL criteria:**
- Technical product with only executive-level messaging (or vice versa)
- Features described in terms the actual decision-maker wouldn't use or care about
- Testimonials from a role that doesn't match the likely homepage visitor

**N/A when:** Product is sold directly to the user (no buying committee, self-serve only).

---

## AP-12: Multi-Order Benefits

**What it is:** The homepage describes benefits that are a benefit of a benefit of a benefit — so abstract that the visitor can't connect them to their daily reality.

**Why it matters:** Fletch calls this the "benefit ladder" problem. First-order benefit: "automates invoice processing." Second-order: "saves your finance team time." Third-order: "lets you scale without hiring." Fourth-order: "drives business growth." The higher you climb, the more abstract and less convincing the claim becomes. Homepages that lead with third- or fourth-order benefits sound impressive but fail to anchor in the visitor's lived experience.

**Source:** Pierri, A. & Fralic, R. Fletch PMM — "Multi-Order Benefits" anti-pattern (2020–2024).

**PASS criteria:**
- Benefits are first-order: directly connected to what the product does ("Automates X," "Replaces Y")
- Visitor can visualize the benefit happening in their daily workflow
- Claims are concrete enough that the visitor could verify them in a trial

**FAIL criteria:**
- Lead benefit is third-order or higher ("Drive growth," "Transform your business," "Unlock potential")
- No first-order benefits visible above the fold
- Benefits require multiple inferential steps to connect to the product's actual function

---

## AP-13: Vision Messaging Instead of Value Messaging

**What it is:** The homepage describes a future state or company vision rather than the current, delivered value of the product.

**Why it matters:** Fletch's teardowns reveal that many B2B SaaS companies confuse vision with value. "We're building the future of X" is a vision statement. "Our product does Y for Z" is a value statement. Visitors arrive with a current problem — they don't care about the company's five-year roadmap. Vision messaging is appropriate for keynotes and investor presentations, not for a homepage that needs to convert visitors with immediate needs.

**Source:** Pierri, A. & Fralic, R. Fletch PMM — "Vision vs. Value Messaging" (2020–2024).

**PASS criteria:**
- Headline describes what the product does today, not what it will become
- Value propositions are present-tense and concrete
- Company vision/mission is secondary to product value (if present at all)

**FAIL criteria:**
- Headline is a vision statement ("Building the future of…," "Reimagining…," "The next generation of…")
- "Our mission" or "Our vision" prominently featured above the fold
- Product capabilities described in future tense ("will enable," "is designed to")
- Company story dominates over product value

## AP-14: Meaningless Modifiers

**What it is:** The homepage relies on vague, subjective modifiers that add no information — words like "revolutionary," "innovative," "cutting-edge," "next-generation," "world-class," "best-in-class."

**Why it matters:** These words are noise. Every product on the market claims to be "innovative" and "cutting-edge." They consume space that could be used for specific, differentiating claims. Worse, they signal to savvy buyers that the company doesn't have real differentiators to point to — if they did, they'd describe them instead of using adjectives. Research on processing fluency shows that specific claims are more persuasive than superlatives.

**Source:** Ries, A. & Trout, J. *Positioning* (1981), on the danger of "better" claims. Supported by processing fluency research — specific claims are perceived as more credible than vague superlatives.

**PASS criteria:**
- Modifiers are specific and verifiable ("2x faster than," "reduces by 40%," "integrates with 50+ tools")
- Product qualities are demonstrated rather than asserted
- Language is concrete throughout — minimal adjective-heavy marketing speak

**FAIL criteria:**
- 3+ instances of empty modifiers ("revolutionary," "best-in-class," "cutting-edge," "world-class")
- Superlatives used without evidence ("the fastest," "the most powerful," "the smartest")
- Feature descriptions rely on adjectives instead of specifics

---

## AP-15: Vague Business Outcomes

**What it is:** The homepage promises broad business outcomes ("drive growth," "unlock potential," "transform your business") without connecting them to the product's specific mechanism.

**Why it matters:** Vague outcomes are unfalsifiable — and therefore unconvincing. They're the positioning equivalent of fortune cookie wisdom: technically true for everyone, useful for no one. When every SaaS product promises to "accelerate growth" and "improve efficiency," these phrases become invisible. The visitor's brain filters them out as noise, and the real value proposition (if one exists) gets lost.

**Source:** Derived from MECLABS Clarity Index principles — vague outcomes increase cognitive cost without adding value. Also supported by Dunford's emphasis on concrete value mapping (DC-3).

**PASS criteria:**
- Outcomes are specific and measurable ("Close deals 40% faster," "Cut onboarding from 2 weeks to 2 days")
- The mechanism is clear — visitor understands HOW the product delivers the outcome
- Outcomes are scoped to the target customer's context, not universally applicable

**FAIL criteria:**
- Lead outcome is a vague platitude ("Drive growth," "Unlock potential," "Transform your business")
- Outcomes lack specificity — could describe any product in any category
- No mechanism explained — the product just magically produces results

---

## AP-16: Empty Tech Claims

**What it is:** The homepage claims technical capabilities (AI, machine learning, automation) without explaining what they specifically do, what data they use, or what outcome they produce.

**Why it matters:** "AI-powered" has become the tech equivalent of "all-natural" — so overused that it's meaningless without substantiation. Buyers who actually need AI capabilities will probe for specifics. Those who don't will see the claim as marketing fluff. Either way, unsubstantiated tech claims hurt credibility rather than helping it. The exception: when the technical claim is followed immediately by a specific outcome it enables.

**Source:** Derived from Dunford's Trend-Riding trap (AP-7) applied specifically to technology claims. Also supported by MECLABS credibility research — unsubstantiated claims increase visitor anxiety.

**PASS criteria:**
- Technical claims are followed by specifics: what the technology does, what data it uses, what outcome it produces
- Technology capabilities are demonstrated (screenshots, demos, examples) not just asserted
- Technical terms match the audience's sophistication level

**FAIL criteria:**
- "AI-powered" or "machine learning" mentioned without explaining the mechanism
- Technology is positioned as the value rather than as the enabler of a customer outcome
- Technical claims that the target audience can't evaluate or verify

---

## AP-17: Buzzword Compounds

**What it is:** The homepage describes the product using compound jargon phrases — stacking buzzwords into multi-word descriptions that sound impressive but communicate nothing specific.

**Why it matters:** "End-to-end intelligent automation platform" is six words that say less than "automates your invoices." Buzzword compounds are a symptom of positioning by committee (AP-4) — each stakeholder adds a word until the description is incomprehensible. They fail both the Fletch "what is it?" test and the MECLABS clarity check. Every additional buzzword reduces the probability that the visitor finishes reading the sentence.

**Source:** Derived from Fletch PMM's "What Is It?" test failure patterns. Also supported by processing fluency research — compound descriptors increase cognitive load and reduce comprehension.

**PASS criteria:**
- Product descriptions use simple noun-verb structures
- Category descriptions are recognizable (1-3 words, no stacking)
- A non-technical person could read the description aloud without stumbling

**FAIL criteria:**
- Product described as "[adjective] [adjective] [buzzword] [buzzword] platform/solution"
- Three or more jargon terms stacked in a single phrase
- Description requires parsing — can't be understood in a single reading

---

## AP-18: Feature Soup

**What it is:** The homepage lists features exhaustively without hierarchy, prioritization, or narrative structure — a "kitchen sink" approach that presents everything the product does with equal emphasis.

**Why it matters:** Feature soup is the opposite of positioning — it's a catalog, not a story. When every feature gets equal billing, none stands out, and the visitor's takeaway is "it does a lot of stuff" rather than "it solves my specific problem." This is especially damaging above the fold, where the visitor's first impression should be a single, clear value proposition, not a feature inventory.

**Source:** Derived from MECLABS signal-to-noise principles — every additional feature listed without hierarchy reduces the clarity of the primary message. Also supported by Ries & Trout's Law of Focus — owning one thing beats listing twenty.

**PASS criteria:**
- Features are organized with clear hierarchy — primary value proposition stands out
- Above-the-fold content focuses on 1-3 key capabilities, not an exhaustive list
- Features are grouped by customer outcome, not by product component
- Progressive disclosure: overview first, details available for those who want them

**FAIL criteria:**
- 5+ features listed above the fold with no clear hierarchy
- Features organized by product architecture ("Platform," "Modules," "Add-ons") rather than customer need
- Equal visual weight given to all features — no primary message
- The homepage reads more like a specification sheet than a positioning page
