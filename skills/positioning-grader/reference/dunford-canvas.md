# Dunford Canvas (DC-1 to DC-5)

## DC-1: Competitive Alternatives Acknowledged

**What it is:** The homepage makes clear what the customer would do if this product didn't exist — spreadsheets, manual processes, a named competitor, or the status quo.

**Why it matters:** If you don't anchor against a real alternative, the visitor can't judge whether your product is better. Positioning only works relative to something. Customers always have a comparison in mind; if you don't set it, they'll pick one themselves — and it may not flatter you.

**Source:** Dunford, A. *Obviously Awesome: How to Nail Product Positioning so Customers Get It, Buy It, Love It* (2019), Chapter 5 — "Step 1: Understand the Customers' Point of View."

**PASS criteria:**
- Homepage names or strongly implies what the customer would use instead (e.g., "Replace your spreadsheets," "Unlike [competitor]," "Stop doing X manually")
- The competitive frame is realistic — not a strawman

**FAIL criteria:**
- No mention of alternatives, status quo, or what the product replaces
- Only generic phrases like "the best solution" with no anchoring
- Claims differentiation without establishing what it's differentiated from

## DC-2: Unique Attributes Articulated

**What it is:** The homepage communicates specific capabilities or features that the competitive alternatives cannot match.

**Why it matters:** Unique attributes are the raw material of differentiation. Without them, a product is a commodity — interchangeable with any alternative. Dunford argues that positioning must start from what you can actually do that others can't, not from aspirational claims.

**Source:** Dunford, A. *Obviously Awesome* (2019), Chapter 6 — "Step 2: Isolate Your Unique Attributes."

**PASS criteria:**
- At least one specific capability, feature, or approach is named that competitors lack
- The uniqueness is concrete (technology, methodology, data source, integration) not abstract ("better," "smarter," "faster")
- A visitor could verify or test the claim

**FAIL criteria:**
- All stated features are table-stakes for the category (e.g., "easy to use," "cloud-based," "secure")
- No features or capabilities are described at all
- Uniqueness is only asserted ("We're different") without specifics

## DC-3: Value Mapped to Customer Outcomes

**What it is:** The unique attributes are translated into concrete value — time saved, revenue gained, risk reduced, or a measurable business outcome the customer cares about.

**Why it matters:** Features alone don't sell; customers buy outcomes. Dunford's framework insists on a direct line from "what we have that others don't" → "what that means for you." If the homepage stops at features without connecting them to value, visitors are left to do the translation themselves — and most won't bother.

**Source:** Dunford, A. *Obviously Awesome* (2019), Chapter 7 — "Step 3: Map Attributes to Value Themes."

**PASS criteria:**
- Features are connected to at least one measurable outcome (time, money, risk, effort)
- The value is stated from the customer's perspective, not the vendor's ("You save 10 hours/week" not "We have automation")
- Outcome is specific enough to be credible

**FAIL criteria:**
- Only features listed without explaining why the customer should care
- Value is vague ("improve efficiency," "drive growth") without a concrete outcome
- Benefits described are too abstract to verify or imagine

## DC-4: Target Customer Identified

**What it is:** The homepage makes clear who the ideal customer is — by role, company size, industry, use case, or problem they face.

**Why it matters:** Positioning that tries to speak to everyone ends up resonating with no one. Dunford emphasizes that the best-fit customer is the one who cares most about your unique value. When a visitor arrives and doesn't see themselves reflected, they bounce. When they do see themselves, conversion rates increase dramatically.

**Source:** Dunford, A. *Obviously Awesome* (2019), Chapter 8 — "Step 4: Find Your Best-Fit Customers."

**PASS criteria:**
- Homepage names a target role, persona, team, industry, or company size (e.g., "Built for product teams," "For mid-market SaaS companies")
- Target is specific enough to exclude some audiences
- Social proof (logos, testimonials) reinforces the stated target

**FAIL criteria:**
- No target audience mentioned — product appears to be for "everyone"
- Target is so broad it's meaningless ("for businesses," "for teams")
- Social proof contradicts the stated target (e.g., claims "for enterprises" but shows freelancer testimonials)

## DC-5: Market Category Set

**What it is:** The homepage places the product in a recognizable market category so visitors instantly know what "shelf" it belongs on and what expectations to bring.

**Why it matters:** The market category triggers a set of assumptions in the visitor's mind — what features to expect, who the competitors are, and what price range is reasonable. Choosing the wrong category (or none at all) forces visitors to build a mental model from scratch, which most won't do. Dunford shows that category choice is a strategic lever — the same product can win in one category and lose in another.

**Source:** Dunford, A. *Obviously Awesome* (2019), Chapter 9 — "Step 5: Layer on a Market Category (or Subcategory)."

**PASS criteria:**
- The product is placed in a clear category the visitor would recognize (e.g., "CRM," "project management," "data pipeline tool")
- Category is stated explicitly or implied strongly through language, comparisons, and design patterns
- Category choice supports the product's strengths (not a category where it's a weak player)

**FAIL criteria:**
- No recognizable category — visitor has to guess what kind of product this is
- Category is invented jargon that only insiders would understand (e.g., "revenue intelligence orchestration platform")
- Multiple conflicting categories suggested on the same page
